# LinearAlgebra

## Scalars & Vectors

## Normalization

## Determinant of the matrix

## Rank of the matrix

## Row reduction, row-echelon form and reduced row-echelon form

### RowOperations
* Rescale a row
* Add a multiple of one row to another
* Swap two rows

Matrix is in row-echelon form as long as it has the below three properties
* First non-zero entry is called pivot
* Rows with all zero element needs to be at the bottom
* Pivot should be in the form of staircase

Matrix is in reduced row-echelon form as long as it passes as the below two properties along with above one
* pivot should be one
* pivot above and below should be zero
